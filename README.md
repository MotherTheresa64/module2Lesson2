# Lesson 2: Introduction to Python Tuples

## Overview
In this lesson, we explore Python tuplesâ€”a data structure that is similar to lists but immutable. We'll cover how to create, manipulate, and work with tuples, including packing, unpacking, and handling common operations like slicing and counting. Tuples are particularly useful when you need an ordered collection that should not change during runtime.
