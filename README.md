## Overview

In this module, I created two files:

1. **notes.py**: Contains my notes from the lecture.
2. **lessonTwoProject.py**: Contains the completed assignments, including my own variations beyond the provided solutions.

The details of these assignments are listed below.

## ðŸ§ ðŸ““ Engage & Apply: Tuple Exploration

Letâ€™s try a quick exercise to engage with tuples and understand their behavior!

### 1. Create a Tuple
Create a tuple containing at least 4 different data types, such as an integer, string, float, and boolean.

### 2. Access and Print Elements
Access and print the first and last elements of your tuple.

### 3. Attempt to Modify the Tuple
Try modifying one element of the tuple and observe the error. This will help you understand the immutability of tuples.

**Discussion:**  
Python raises an error when you try to modify a tuple because tuples are **immutable**, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed.

## ðŸ‘¾ðŸ’» Final Challenge: Tuple Mastery

Now that youâ€™ve explored the basics, letâ€™s put everything together!

### 1. Create a Tuple
Create a tuple with at least 6 elements. Feel free to mix different data types like integers, strings, and floats.

### 2. Access and Print Elements
Access and print the third and fifth elements using indexing.

### 3. Slice the Tuple
Slice the tuple to extract elements from the second to the fifth position.

### 4. Count Occurrences
Use the `count()` method to find how many times a specific value appears in your tuple.

### 5. Unpack the Tuple
Unpack the tuple into individual variables and print them.

### 6. Concatenate Tuples
Concatenate your tuple with another tuple and print the new tuple.

## Conclusion

This module helped me explore the versatility of tuples in Python, including their creation, manipulation, immutability, and various operations like slicing, counting, and unpacking.
